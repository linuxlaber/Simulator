Version 1.0 Release Date: ?

I made this simulator so that I would be prepared in the future. I would want to work mainly as a computer science researcher or a software engineer. However, I might add a little bit of AI and Machine Learning. So I decided to make a simulator that would showcase the step-by-step procedure of mathematics, physics, and artificial intelligence concepts. Just as the name suggests, this was meant to be a simulator so the geometric interpretation for each problem or input must be showcased. Examples are: Coloumb's Law where I would input the values and the charges would either attract or repel. Or eigenvalues and eigenvectors and after plugging the values, it will show the step by step solution and at the same time, the geometric interpretation.

I have a problem tho. It seems that I lack the expertise on Computer Graphics. This means that on the very first release of this program. It will first serve as a step by step calculator for me to be able to work on computational work related problems as quick as possible. I would be adding the simulation next after I learned more about generating images. Or maybe it will be a separate file. Who knows what would be the final output? Even I don't know. But for all I know and for all I care, I will be finishing it.
